# Live-Intercity-Transit
Live Intercity Transit Map for Canada

## Support
Currently, the project supports VIA rail stations and trains as well as Ontario Northland Stations (Polar Bear Express).
ONR does not supply live realtime data so support is coming, but in a preliminary stage.

## Structure
Java Backend with static data stored on a MySQl server. 
Live data is served by timed AJAX calls.

## Release Date
This project is currently in the preliminary development phase. There is currently no guidelines set for a release date.
